This document is the third report for our Proof Searching and Proof
Checking project, which deals about formal reasoning in Description
Logic a formal tool for knowledge representation. In this report, we
will detail the software validation methods used in the development of
the project, as well as an account of the project management including
a detailed log of our activities.

To enhance the correctness of our code, our software validation
methods include various forms of testing (unit testing, stress testing,
black-box, grey-box and white-box testing) and other tools such
as \emph{hlint}, a bug tracker and code reviews. To ensure good
progress in our project, our management tools include tools
provided by Google Code, most notably Mercurial, 
as well as frequent SCRUM-like meetings.
