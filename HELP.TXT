--DESCRIPTION:

This program searches for models for Description Logic. 
If no such model can be found a proof is provided.

--LOGIC SYNTAX:

The syntax for Description Logic used is the following:
  'Forall' for the universal quantification: Forall Relation (Concept)
  'Exists' for the existential quantification: Exists Relation (Concept)
  'top' for Top/Truth/Tautology (always true): top
  'bot' for Bottom/Falsity (always false): bot
  '&' for the Intersection/And symbol: (concept1)&(concept2)
  '|' for the Union/Or symbol: (concept1)|(concept2)
  '~' for the Complement/Negation symbol: ~(concept)
  ';' to seperate Concepts (Formulaes) in a list: concept1;concept2
The rest represents atomic or binary relation (used in forall and exists).
Brackets can be omitted if there is no doubt.

e.g. Forall R (A|top);~(~(top));A|(A|(B&Exists S (top|bot)))

--OPTIONS

There are the following options
  --help for displaying this message
  --gamma for specifying gamma (in a file or directly)
  	 default is no concepts
  --givens for specifying givens (in a file or directly)
  	 default is no concepts
  --mode for specifying what type of output you wish
  	 -> none for simply stating SATISFIABLE or UNSATISFIABLE
	 -> console for a verbose console output of the model or proof
	 -> graphical for a verbose output in a file
	 default is 'none'
  --output for specifying the output file name (only makes sense for graphical
  outputs) !! NOT THE FILE PATH !!
	default is output
