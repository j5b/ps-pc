In this report we will give an early assessment on the project success, an update on the goals and organisation of the project. We also provide a more precise picture of the overall project structure, notably by giving a clear schedule, a description of how the project is managing its human resources and how the project deals with issues relating to ethics and the environment.

To briefly summarize, we have undertaken a few changes in our project. Notably we have combined two iterations and we have added two features. Overall we have managed to meet the requirements for the two first iterations. In the next iterations we have planned to support other more expressive logics, perform yet more testing and deal with cycles in the knowledge base. We have also explained how to ensure the proper work dynamics of our project through careful management of human ressources. Finally we explain that since our project deals with proof and model search no particular issue concerning ethics or the environment arise.
