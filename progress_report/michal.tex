Beside dealing with technical issues, the organisation of our project carefully handles the management of the human ressources involved in the project, to guarantee its success. We perform the following actions to ensure the proper work dynamics between the members of the group: assignement of tasks and roles, regular and frequent meetings, evualation by each team member of the work completed. These actions are undertaken in order to deal with the following problems:

\begin{itemize}
\item How to handle the different levels and areas of skills of each individual in the group ?
\item How to ensure the workload in fairly divided amongst group members ?
\item How to ensure a smooth progress in the project?
\item How to guarantee that no group member is caught under performing ?
\end{itemize}

The different levels and areas of skills of each individual in the group is delt by rigorously matching tasks and people according to the main area of competence. Additionally we enhance a learning process to improve our team members skills. This is done through the means of code review and frequent meetings whose purpose is to discuss technical and theoretical issues. Code review allows team members to share their skills by explaining how others' code can be improved. The meetings are organised on a per need basis, to solve any problem that has risen from a gap in our technical and theoretical knowledge.

To ensure that the workload is fairly divided amongst group members, we start by carefully analysing the goals we are required to meet, in order to derive possible tasks. The tasks are chosen in such a way that each corresponds to a similar amount of work. The tasks are then assigned to group members equally. Additionally to subdivision of goals into tasks and their assignement, we have regular and frequent meetings to assess people progress and handle any technical and/or managerial issues. These meetings have for goal to avoid the creation of delays in the project development, guaranteeing smooth progress.

The regular meetings mentionned above also serve for the purpose of discovering if any team member is under performing. If a group member doesn't put enough effort in the project, the lack of work will be dealt as soon as possible with the person involved.
