This report is the final report for the Proof Search meets Proof Check
project which is about formal reasoning in a formal representation
of knowledge language called Description Logic. More specifically our 
project is about deciding the satisfiability or otherwise unsatisfiability
of a given knowledge base. The report will provide a detailled account of
most aspects involved in the project.

After introducing to our project we will first explain the theoretical
and technical background involved in the project, then we will mention
all engineering aspects of the project both managerial and
technical. Amongst the engineering aspects we will comment upon are
our Software Development practices, our testing pratices,our progress
of the project and the use of the technology available. Finally we
will end with an asssessement on the success of the project.
