Our software is a tool for formal reasoning in a knowledge
representation framework called Description Logic. Description Logic
find many uses in Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics and Web
Semantic. The latter is one of the most prominent examples of application of
Description Logic since it is the founding block where it 
provides a way create a knowledge domain for websites.

More specifically our software provides a tool for showing
satisfiability by generating a model or otherwise showing
unsatisfiability by giving a proof for a given knowledge base
described in Description Logic. The program was written in Haskell for
the GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) Platform and is intented to run on
most platforms and has been tested on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and
is licensed under the open-source license GPL 3.0.

Unlike most other Description Logic solvers focused for Web Semantics
OWL our software is targeted for academia: it is highly flexible
especially since the software has been written in the high level
pratical for logic language Haskell and is open-source; it focuses on
providing short, correct and clear outputs of the obtained models and
proofs in a graphical or a textual format.
