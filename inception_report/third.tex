% Specification of length of, and dates for, first iteration.

Our first iteration started on 22/10/10 and will end after two weeks on 05/11/10.
In the beginning of the iteration all team members acquired a theoretical understanding
of the task by reading papers on description logic and proof/model searching [maybe get
more specific here: what papers].

% Details mapping of iteration tasks onto group members (-> Sprint backlog).

The tasks for our first iteration are as in the sprint backlog in table \ref{sprint}.

\begin{table} \label{sprint}

    %\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Tasks} \\

    specification of model as haskell data type & group & 29/10/10 \\
    specification of proof as haskell data type & group & 29/10/10 \\
    implementation of proof/model search for \mathcal{AL} & Jannis, Sagie & 29/10/10 \\
    implementation of model checker for \mathcal{AL} & Michal & 05/11/10 \\
    implementation of proof checker for \mathcal{AL} & Ka Wai & 05/11/10 \\

% Identification of potential risks during first iteration.

risks: research: need to understand theory, 
                 need to find suitable algorithms and adapt them for our setup
if this takes more time than expected we might not meeet the deadline
as mentioned before, while trying to quickly satisfy the key requirements we also
try to implement the most basic behavior first. the functionality will then be
extended in future iterations

% Planned progress measure for first iteration.

- success: we were successful if our program can take an \mathcal{AL} concept and produce
  either a model or a proof. model and proof can than be checked for correctness.

- progress: we will have regular meetings (twice a week) to track the tasks and be able
            to indentify problems and deal with them. this will allow us to always know
            exactly where we are.
