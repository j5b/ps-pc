\subsection{Software Development Method}

\paragraph{}
A blend of several agile software development methods will be adopted; mainly eXtreme Programming, Scrum and Orange Crystal; which were suitable for this project. Agile software development methods will minimise risk and allow the project to adapt to changes quickly by the use of short iterations and ensuring there is a working product at the end of each iteration, which will be presented to the client (Dirk Pattinson) for feedback.

\paragraph{}
Pair programming will be used for overlapping areas of the program and where sections of the program, implemented by different team members, meet in order for their to be m
The test-driven nature of this development method will be an essential part of our project development since the integrity of our code is very important and directly impacts our key requirements.

\paragraph{}
We willl be keeping a product backlog and a sprint backlog

\paragraph{}
As well as the aforementioned methods, we also considered Unified Processing, but it was .
However, we felt good feature of UP was to implement high risk elements in early iterations. This feature will be adopted so that the most critical key requirements are met first before implementing the additional features such as giving the proof or model in human readable format as an output and extending the program to allow less restrictive languages to be used.

\subsection{Code testing and Version Control}

\paragraph{}
As part of eXtreme Programming's test-driven, unit tests will be written before coding the functions or simultaneously and will be tested as they are implemented.

\subsection{Needed Information Technology}

\paragraph{}
The project will be developed on GoogleCode allowing easy code reviews by other team members and Mercurial will be used in conjunction as our version control.
Members will need Mercurial to be installed on their usual workstation.

\subsection{Project Management}

\paragraph{}
Scrum meetings will be used when we have a group meeting at least twice a week. For the first few iterations, our meetings will continue after the scrum meetings, to discuss the possible algorithms and proof rules used. This is because it will affect all areas of the program and important for everyone to understand the code under eXtreme Programming and make each member's code as compatible as possible.

At the end of each iteration, there will be a meeting with the client, Dirk Patttinson, where a demo 

\subsection{Missing}

\paragraph{}
Why did we choose Google Code? Mecurial? How measure project progess or velocity. Permanent roles and responsibilities team members have throughout project
