Although the following features are not essential for the project to be considered a success, they
form goals the project aims to meet:

\begin{itemize}
\item Extend the program to more expressive logics (for instance logics with number restrictions, probabilities, ...)
\item Implementation of a parser for reading concepts in Description Logic
\item Ability to represent models and proofs in a graphical representation
\item User interface to the program
\item Find the shortest proof and/or smallest model for a given concept
\end{itemize}
