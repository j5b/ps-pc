This project is about correct knowledge representation. More precisely, our program will have a knowledge base, expressed formally as concepts of description logic. Given a statement it will be able to check if it is consistent with the knowledge base. It will either provide a proof that the statement is unsatisfiable or an example demonstrating it is possible, called a model. Tools like this are widely used, for example in medicine to offer diagnoses to doctors. However, because of their complexity they often provide false answers, which can have fatal consequences. This is why our program will provide its full reasoning as an output, so it can be automatically checked for correctness. We will develop correctness checkers for both proofs and models in parallel to the main program.

This document provides the project key and optional requirements as well as our choice of software development method, our first iteration plan and a draft schedule for the project.
