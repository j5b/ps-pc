% Broader introduction explain more about description logic, satisfiability, knowlegde base, 
% proofs, models are. What is the a possible use of this program.
Our project is about description logic, which is a framework for formal represention of knowledge and reasoning. More precisely, the project provides formal arguments called proofs or examples called models for statements in description logic called concepts. Description logic is a widely used tool in particular in biology or medicine. We aim to create a program,
which receives as an input a formal representation of knowledge and provides proofs and/or models as an answer. 

We will create a tool that checks satisfiability for concepts given a knowledge base that is the existence of a model where the concept holds. If the given formula is satisfiable, a model will be provided, otherwise a proof will be generated demonstrating the unsatisfiability of the given concepts. In addition, the program will be able to check if given proofs or models are correctly constructed.

This document provides the project key and optional requirements as well as our choice of software development method, our first iteration plan and a draft schedule for the project.
