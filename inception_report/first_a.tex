The project's intent is to create a tool that checks satisfiability for a description logic formula given a knowledge base. If the given formula is satisfiable, a model will be provided, otherwise a proof will be generated demonstrating the unsatisfiability of the given concept. In addition the program will be able to check if given proofs or models are correct.

This document provides the project key and optional requirements as well as our choice of software development method, our first iteration plan and a draft schedule for the project.
