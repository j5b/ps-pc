The project's intent is to create a tool that checks satisfiability for a Description Logic formula given a knowledge base. If the given formula is satisfiable, a model will be provided, otherwise a proof will be generated demonstrating the unsatisfiability of the given fomula. In addition the program will be able to check if given proofs or models are valid.
