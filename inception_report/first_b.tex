These key requirements have to be met for the project to be considered a success:

\begin{itemize}
\item Correct representation of concepts, models and proofs from Description Logic as Haskell abstract data type
\item Implementation in Haskell of a model/proof searching algorithm for Description Logic which is correct and which terminates
\item Implementation in Haskell of a model checking algorithm for Description Logic that checks
if a model is correct
\item Implementation in Haskell of a proof checking algorithm for Description Logic that checks if a proof is correct
\end{itemize}
