The following are key requirements which are critical, high-risk and essential for the project success:

\begin{itemize}
\item Representation of concepts, models and proofs from description logic 
\item Implementation in of a model/proof searching algorithm for description logic which is correct and which terminates
\item Implementation of a model checking algorithm for description logic that checks
if a model is correct
\item Implementation of a proof checking algorithm for description logic that checks if a proof is correct
\end{itemize}
