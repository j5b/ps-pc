\section{Project Key Requirements}

This key requirements has to be met for the project to be considered a success:

\begin{itemize}
\item Correct representation of concepts, models and proofs from Description Logic as Haskell Abstract Data Type
\item Implementation in Haskell of a Model/Proof searching algorithm for Description Logic which is correct and which terminates
\item Implementation in Haskell of a Model checking algorithm for Description Logic that checks
if a Model is valid
\item Implementation in Haskell of a Proof checking algorithm for Description Logic that checks if a proof is valid
\end{itemize}
