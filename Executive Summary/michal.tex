The aim of our project was to create a solver for Description Logic, a
knowlegde representation language. We have managed to create a softare
intented for the GHC platform that decide satisfiability or otherwise
unsatisfiability of a given knowledge base together with some
concepts. Unlike most solvers for Description Logic the one we
create is intented for academia.

Amongst the many varieties of Description Logic we have chosen
$\mathcal{ALC}$ for our software. The language provides a way to
describe knowledge about the properties and relations that might
exists between individuals, this is done through concepts. More formally
the syntax is defined upon a set of atoms and a set of relations and
from those sets complex formulas can be derived by using unions,
intersections, complements, universal and existential
restrictions; and the semantics is defined through a mapping from concepts
to a domain called an interpretation.
